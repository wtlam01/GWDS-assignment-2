        Welcome to Fresh Re-Share!

At Fresh Re-Share, we're on a mission to tackle food waste and nourish our community. Founded by newlyweds Mindy and Mike, who come from a background in sustainable farming, we're more than just a restaurant – we're a movement towards a more sustainable future.

Our Story:
Mindy and Mike's journey began with a deep-seated commitment to combating food waste in our local area. Seeing the abundance of fresh produce going to waste, they decided to take action. They established a nonprofit organization dedicated to diverting food from supermarkets and distributors, transforming it into delicious meals for our patrons.

Our Vision:
Fresh Re-Share is not just about providing nourishing meals; it's about fostering a sense of community and empowerment. We believe that everyone should have access to fresh, nutritious food, regardless of their financial circumstances. That's why we operate on a "Pay As You Feel" basis – ensuring that everyone can enjoy a meal with dignity and autonomy.

What We Offer:

A Rotating Menu: Our daily menu is crafted using diverted fresh food, ensuring that every meal is not only delicious but also sustainable.
Fresh Food Boxes: Subscribe to our weekly food box service and receive fresh fruits, vegetables, and cupboard goods, sourced directly from local markets and grocery stores.
Volunteer Opportunities: We welcome volunteers who wish to contribute their time and skills in exchange for food box collection. It's a chance to give back to the community and make a difference.
Join Us:
Whether you're a student, a young family, or someone passionate about fighting food waste, we invite you to join us at Fresh Re-Share. Together, we can create positive change, one meal at a time.
